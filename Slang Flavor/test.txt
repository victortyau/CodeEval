Very true. And yet upon this profession which is presented to us under the fair name of art has come an evil reputation. But, seeing that we are now only discoursing and not acting, let our selection be supposed to be completed, and the desired purity attained.

Three years study is not long enough to give a knowledge of these intricacies and our pupils will have many things of more importance to learn! You talk rather grandly! Shall they, like the women of Thrace, tend cattle and till the ground or, like our own, spin and weave, and take care of the house! For servants and masters cannot be friends, and, although equality makes friendship, we must remember that there are two sorts of equality.
And the reason of this is that no mans nature is able to know what is best for human society or knowing, always able and willing to do what is best.
Quite true! And which may be supposed to be the truer judgment - that of the inferior or of the better soul.
The whole choral art is also in our view the whole of education and of this art, rhythms and harmonies form the part which has to do with the voice. I maintain that this colony of ours has a father and mother, who are no other than the colonizing state. And this tenth kind of motion is the mightiest, and is really the first, and is followed by that which was improperly called the ninth.
There are traces in the Laws of the same desire to base speculation upon history which we find in the Critias.
And in the village will there be the same war of family against family, and of individual against individual. Or an artist, who was clever in his profession, but a rogue.

Their writings extend altogether over more than eight hundred years, from the second to the tenth century? And in everything but what is bad the same rule holds? Then now, my friend, let us observe what will happen in the constitution of out intended state. I shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right.
What do you mean. What thing. And the chorus is made up of two parts, dance and song.
The judge must determine the fact and to him also the punishment must sometimes be left.
